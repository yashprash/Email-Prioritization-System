# Email Prioritization System

## Technology Stack
Django, Python, Natural Language Processing (Pre-processing using NLTK, RNN using Keras)

## Introduction
The email prioritization system provides the user with a personalized way to prioritize and view their emails, according to what the user considers to be important, and selects as their top three priority categories. The user chooses 3 categories of interest (out of 6 available options). All incoming emails are classified into one of the three categories of interest, or into a separate folder if the email does not match any of the categories selected by the user.

## Description
The front-end user interface of the system has been designed using the Django framework. The system, upon first login of the user, allows the user to select 3 categories of their interest, out of 6 available categories- Business and Industrial, Science and Technology, Finance and News, Education and Government. Fitness and Automotive, and Art, Entertainment and Society. Once the user selects their priority 1, priority 2 and priority 3 categories, four folders are created, with three of them designed to receive emails from each of the three chosen categories, and the fourth folder to receive emails which do not belong any of the three categories of the user’s interest. The classification into the category folders is performed using the multiclass classification output vector generated by a recurrent neural network model, trained using a dataset of 10000 emails of the open source Enron email dataset. The text contents of the test email(s) first undergo pre-processing in order to eliminate all punctuation and stop-words, and lemmatization is performed. This is followed by the conversion of the text into word indices vector by indexing into the word corpus of the GloVe vector representation, which is provided as input to the model. The model consists of an embedding layer as the first layer, which converts the input to the respective embedding vector obtained using the GloVe vectors, followed by a LSTM layer, dropout layer and output layer. The output of the model is a 6X1 vector, with the the highest value corresponding to the input email’s matched category. 

## Application
Currently, mail service providers like Google Mail (Gmail) only provide an automated spam classifier, and classification into three fixed categories- Primary, Social and Promotions. The proposed email prioritization system has the ability to perform personalized prioritization and classification of email messages based on user’s personal interest and choice. The sample email inbox, along with the category priority folders are implemented in Python using Django. A sample database of emails is linked, from which emails are loaded. The text is extracted from the received email and the python script to perform pre-processing and prediction using the trained model, is executed on the contents of the received email. On the basis of the output vector produced, the email is placed in one of the three category folders, or is placed in the last folder if the email does not match any categories of interest to the user.
